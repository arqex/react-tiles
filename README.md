# react-tiles

An awesome react component that allows to display more than one app route at the same time dividing your browser in tiles.

Want to see it working? *(Have a look at the demo)[https://react-tiles.firebaseapp.com]*.

react-tiles is thought to be simple to use, so just adding the component to the root component of your app you will turn it into a multi-route application.

## Under development.
Right now the library is pretty usable but it is still in a *beta stage*. The API can vary a lot, mainly because there is plenty room for improvements and customization.

Any help that I can have in this project is welcome. I have created a playground to let every developer interested in collaborate to have an environment to play with the code easily:

[react-tiles playground](https://github.com/arqex/react-tiles-playground).

Right now there is a bunch of features missing that I would like to see in react-tiles. Here I leave a list of some that comes to my mind, if you are interested in tackle some of them, please create issues to discuss about them there:

* Tests <-- *This is the most important one*.
* Define minimum heigth/with of the tiles using props.
* Create a way of defining tile's position and dimensions.
* Create a way of make tiles uncloseable.
* Tile minification.
* Solve `tilecontrols` bar being at the top of the tile covering the top of the content.
* Create a way of customize the `tilecontrols`.
